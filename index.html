    <h2> WHAT IS JAVA ?</h2>
    <section id="para">
        <p>Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation
            dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA),
            meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for
            recompilation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile
            devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for
            enterprise-level applications.

            JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1995 and later acquired by Oracle
            Corporation. It is a simple programming language. Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming
            easy.
            It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming
            language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java
            code
            can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any
            Java
            Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

            History: Java’s history is very interesting. It is a programming language created in 1991. James Gosling,
            Mike
            Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton, a team of Sun engineers known as the Green team initiated the Java language
            in
            1991. Sun Microsystems released its first public implementation in 1996 as Java 1.0. It provides no-cost
            -run-times on popular platforms. Java1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur Van Hoff to strictly
            comply
            with its specifications. With the arrival of Java 2, new versions had multiple configurations built for
            different types of platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO standards body and later formalized Java, but it soon withdrew
            from
            the process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their
            proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized
            products such as the Java Enterprise System.


            On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine as free, open-source software. On May 8,
            2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM’s core code available under open-source distribution
            terms.

            The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high-performance, portable, multi-threaded,
            interpreted, dynamic, etc. In 1995 Java was developed by James Gosling, who is known as the Father of Java.
            Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.</p>
